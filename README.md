# CM523 Project Starter

You may use this repo as a 'starter' kit for your project. In it you will find...
- the homepage (index.html) boilerplate with comments/annotations
- a styles directory that includes the `normalize.css` reset and your `styles.css` file (write all of your CSS in that file)
- a scripts directory that includes a `scripts.js` file (where you will write your JS) and a vendor directory where you can include external JS libraries
- an images directory (put ALL of your images in this directory)

## A few notes
- index.html is your home page -- it is not home.html or anything else!
- No capital letters or spaces in any file or directory.
- Think critically about your naming conventions. Things like page1.html, page2.html, are typically not helpful. Same with your CSS class names and JS variable/function names.
- You don't have to create a directory for pages; they belong in the main directory.
- Resize your images to fit the context. For example, if you have an image asset that is 1000px by 500px, but you only use it at 500px by 250px... then resize it to fit. Don't waste bytes. 
- Don't throw aside all the lessons you learned this semester... accessibility, green design, atomic design, responsive design, CSS architecture, design systems, typography, layout, color, negative space, etc.
- Don't 'Google' your way through the project. Think about how you can APPLY what you've learned to build your project. If you don't see an obvious path, ASK for help. Trying to retro-fit someone else's solution for a similar problem is NOT learning.   




## My Notes/Feedback
- the scroll snap is nice and snappy, don't mess with that function too much.
- add arrows for indicating scroll left or right. 
- add some interactive to arrow, switches direction based on being on one end or the other of the scroll. not to complicated with javascript.
- change up alignment of text. center aligned for long paragraphs is not great, think about redesign for that.
- Add a few more ciders, make sure there is at least 1 for every option in the search.
- cider finder recommendation, add some result text to indicate results are showing up below. a little feedback for the user.
- can remove some of the navigation links because they don;t link to anything.

- Maybe kep going. Jazz up the footer, it can be more fun.
- try some drop caps maybe?
- a break that is a leafy branch.
